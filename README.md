My first try in automation 


For start this code u must: 
1. Download selenium
write "pip install selenium" to terminal ("pip3 install selenium" if u use Mac OS)
2. Download chromedriver for your browser version. U can do it from official website: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
3. Change the path to the driver in main.py to the actual one for you
